# iot-icu-patient-monitoring-system
IoT-Based ICU Patient Monitoring System using ESP8266, sensors, and Blynk app. Monitors heart rate, temperature, IV fluid level, and patient motion in real time with alerts via LCD, buzzer, and mobile notifications. Low-cost, scalable solution for hospitals and home care. 
# IoT-Based ICU Patient Monitoring System
## üìñ Project Overview
A real-time, IoT-based system that monitors ICU patient vitals: heart rate, body temperature, IV fluid level, and movement. Built using ESP8266 NodeMCU and biomedical sensors, this system provides local alerts and remote monitoring through the Blynk IoT platform.
